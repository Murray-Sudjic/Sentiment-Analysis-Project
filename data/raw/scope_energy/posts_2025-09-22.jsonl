I understand it\u2019s pretty obvious markets would react negatively but how detrimental really would a large scale war in Europe be financially? \n\nRussia\u2019s control of oil supply could send gas prices soaring but what about the economic impact from Eastern Europe at war? Russia doesn\u2019t seem to be ready for a full scale war against NATO and seems to be testing the waters but they are preparing to do so. I think if we see congressmen start selling off their stocks like we saw before COVID that would be a great sell signal to GTFO before the market crashes. \n\nHistorically how have markets reacted to large scale wars? We haven\u2019t really had a large scale war since WW2 so we don\u2019t have recent examples to go off of except maybe around 9\/11 and the beginning of war in the Middle East but that doesn\u2019t affect global markets like a war in Europe would. I also assume investing in defense contractors would turn out to be very profitable. \n\nWhat does everyone think? Will this be the next big stock market correction or are there bigger problems near term?","score":0,"num_comments":54,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/stocks\/comments\/1nnbjm5\/could_the_potential_invasion_of_eastern_europe_by\/","keyword_matched":"oil","scope_name":"scope_energy","ingested_at_utc":1758539883,"is_comment":false}

Last week, they\u2019ve issued a statement on it welcoming in the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of nuclear energy.  \nhttps:\/\/www.rolls-royce.com\/media\/press-releases\/2025\/15-09-2025-rr-welcomes-action-from-uk-and-us-governments-to-usher-in-new-golden-age-of-nuclear-energy.aspx\n\n- Rolls-Royce builds and maintains the Nuclear reactors powering submarines.  They signed a \u00a39,000,000,000 contract with the UK Ministry of Defence to provide long-term support for the existing fleet and future builds, securing its role in the UK's nuclear deterrent for decades to come.  More countries will look to sign similar deals. \nhttps:\/\/www.rolls-royce.com\/media\/press-releases\/2025\/24-01-2025-rolls-royce-signs-landmark-unity-contract-with-uk-ministry-of-defence.aspx\n\n\n- Earlier in September, Rolls-Royce announced their involvement in providing reactors for Australia's new fleet of nuclear submarines, under the AUKUS defense agreement with the UK and US, further expanding its role in nuclear submarine technology: \nhttps:\/\/www.rolls-royce.com\/media\/press-releases\/2025\/10-09-2025-rr-signs-skills-and-technology-agreements-with-western-and-south-australian-governments-in-support-of-aukus.aspx\n\n- Zacks Investment Research have published a bullish pro-Rolls article on Friday entitled: \u201cThe Best AI Nuclear Energy Stock to Buy Not Named Oklo\u201c \nhttps:\/\/www.zacks.com\/commentary\/2754426\/the-best-ai-nuclear-energy-stock-to-buy-not-named-oklo\n\n- Goldman Sachs have initiated coverage of RR with a Buy rating, with a target of \u00a312.90 \/  $17.40  - recognising the turnaround story since covid, and the huge profit margin and FCF improvements in recent years.\n\n- Citigroup have upgraded their price target to \u00a314.40 \/ $19.44.\n(The difference appears to be that Citigroup have recognised how massively exciting the Nuclear Energy side of the business is, whereas Goldman haven\u2019t even mentioned it.)\n\n- The vast majority of analysts are rating RR a buy. \n \n- Saudi Arabia Railways will be using more Rolls-Royce engines in their trains than before. Since 2012, there have been seventy 12V 4000 engines used in trains operated by Saudi Arabia Railways, and \u2013 having been impressed by their quality even in the harshest of conditions \u2013 Saudi Arabia have ordered an additional 50 trains with RR engines, as announced a month ago.

And longer term it\u2019ll be multiples of where it is today. And it is all backed up by solid real results - real revenues, real profit, and real deals worth billions.  \n\nRolls-Royce is a winner !
